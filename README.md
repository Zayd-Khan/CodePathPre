# Prework - Test

Submitted by: Zayd Khan

Test is an app that showcases my name, university and career. It is a very simple app that I used to begin getting familiar with Xcode and Swift.

Time spent: 1.5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Apps:
- Snapchat:
  - Replay snaps
  - Save old messages
- Strong: App that tracks workouts
  - Shows your last workouts set and reps, can make templates for workout split
  - Calendar shows what days you logged a workout
- Photos:
  - Can create different albums to organize pics
  - Shared albums are incredibly useful and a cool way to store memories with friends
- Find My
    - Allows you to see other people/devices locations, can be super convenient w friends and fam
    - Pinging a device you can't find is really useful
    - Can login on someone elses phone to find your phone if missing

App Idea:

  A major driving factor for me to take this course besides the fact that I already took a Codepath course and enjoyed it is that I do have an app idea in mind. Long story short, it is an app that allows the user to "clip" moments in real life with the camera. Instead of setting up your phone to take a long video that could take up a lot of storage, it would constantly be recording and trimming everything but the last set amount of time (e.g. 2 minutes) and you can clip it when something happens that you want to keep, such as you are playing a basketball game and someone makes a nice shot.

## Notes

The biggest challenge would be getting familiar with Xcode. It can be a little confusing at first as there is definitely a lot going on but not so bad once you simplify things.
